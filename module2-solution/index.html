                <p>
                    The median annual salary for waste workers is $40,000, but some make $100,000 or more annually. They earn that money by keeping our streets clean, handling stinky refuse, and risking their lives on a daily basis. Trash and recycling collectors have one of the most dangerous jobs in the world and the fifth most dangerous job in the United States. According to the latest data from the BLS, 31 total deaths were recorded in 2016, many from workers falling off trucks, getting hit by vehicles while on the job, or accidents with machinery. Check out these 9 other unusual high-paying jobs that aren't for everyone.

                <h2>Oilfield workers</h2>
                <p>
                    The Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 that took the lives of 11 men reminded the world that oil rig workers have one of the most dangerous jobs, both offshore and onshore. Heights, heavy equipment, and dangerous materials are just a few risky elements of the job. Surprisingly, the greatest cause of death for oil and extraction laborers was vehicle crashes. Fatigue and long, unsafe travels to and from rigs are two of the reasons these accidents happen so often, according to the CDC. These will be the most in-demand jobs in 2020.

                <h2>Roofers</h2>
                <p>
                    Roofers walk around the tops of our homes and office buildings, so it's not surprising that they have the fourth highest rate of fatalities on the job in the United States, according to the latest data from the BLS. One hundred workers died in 2016, most of them from falling. This risk is not new to the industry, considering falls from roofs accounted for one-third of all fall-related construction deaths between 1992 and 2009.
